# Solving the Maximum Clique Problem via Continuous Optimization

This project, developed for the **Optimization for Data Science** course at the University of Padua, addresses the **Maximum Clique Problem (MCP)** using first-order optimization algorithms.

The MCP is a well-known NP-hard problem that involves finding the largest complete subgraph (a clique) within a given undirected graph. To overcome the combinatorial nature of the problem, it has been reformulated as a continuous optimization problem.

## 📖 Theoretical Approach and Formulation

The approach is based on the Motzkin-Straus formulation, which links the clique problem to a quadratic program. To ensure that the local maxima of the objective function correspond to actual maximal cliques, a regularization term has been added.

The goal is to solve the following optimization problem:

$$
\text{maximize} \quad f(x) := x^T A x + \Phi(x) \quad \text{subject to} \quad x \in \Delta
$$

where:
-   **$A$** is the adjacency matrix of the graph.
-   **$x$** is the vector of optimization variables.
-   **$\Delta$** is the standard simplex: $\Delta := \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid \sum x_i = 1, x_i \geq 0\}$.
-   **$\Phi(x)$** is the regularization function.

Two different regularization functions have been implemented and compared:
1.  **$L_2$ Regularization**: $\Phi_{l2}(x) = \frac{\alpha}{2} \|x\|_2^2$
2.  **$L_0$ Approximation**: $\Phi_{l0}(x) = \alpha \sum_{i=1}^n (\exp(-\beta x_i) - 1)$

## 🤖 Implemented Algorithms

Four first-order optimization algorithms were implemented, each tested with three different step-size strategies.

### Algorithms
1.  **Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)**: Performs a gradient step followed by a projection onto the simplex.
2.  **Frank-Wolfe (FW)**: A projection-free method that optimizes a linear approximation of the objective function.
3.  **Pairwise Frank-Wolfe (PFW)**: A variant that moves "mass" between the best and worst vertices, accelerating convergence.
4.  **Away-step Frank-Wolfe (AFW)**: Improves PFW by dynamically choosing between a standard (FW) direction and an "away" direction.

### Step-Size Strategies
* **Optimal (Exact Line Search)**: Computes the optimal step-size at each iteration.
* **Armijo**: A backtracking rule that ensures sufficient progress.
* **Fixed**: Uses a constant, predefined step-size.

## 📈 Results and Analysis

The algorithms were evaluated on benchmark graphs from the **DIMACS challenge**. The analysis yielded the following insights:

* **Best Performance**: The combination of **Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)** with **$L_0$ regularization** and a **fixed step-size** proved to be the most effective, finding the largest cliques on average.
* **Impact of Regularization**: The $L_0$ regularization showed a clear superiority, better guiding the algorithms toward sparse solutions that represent cliques.
* **Computational Efficiency**: Fixed step-size strategies were the fastest. Exact line search, while theoretically powerful, was too slow for practical use with PGD.
* **Robustness**: The Frank-Wolfe algorithms (FW and AFW) proved to be more stable and less sensitive to the choice of step-size compared to PGD and PFW.

In conclusion, the project highlighted the strong synergy between the PGD algorithm and a regularization function that accurately models the combinatorial nature of the problem, demonstrating the effectiveness of continuous optimization for solving the maximum clique problem.
