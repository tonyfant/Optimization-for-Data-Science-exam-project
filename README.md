# OPTIMIZATION_PROJECT

## Overview

This project explores and implements advanced optimization techniques to solve complex real-world problems. The repository includes a suite of algorithms, methodologies, and experiments focused on achieving efficient and robust solutions. The main code and experiments are documented in `final_project.ipynb`.

## Methodologies


- **Mathematical Modeling:** Problems are formulated using mathematical models to define constraints and objectives precisely.
- **Linear Programming (LP):** Techniques such as the Simplex method are applied to solve problems with linear constraints and objectives.
- **Nonlinear Programming (NLP):** Algorithms for handling nonlinear relationships are implemented for more complex scenarios.
- **Metaheuristics:** Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing are used for optimization problems where classical methods are insufficient or impractical.
- **Gradient-Based Optimization:** Methods like Gradient Descent are employed for continuous optimization tasks.
- **Constraint Handling:** Specialized approaches are used to manage equality and inequality constraints within optimization problems.
- **Data Preprocessing and Analysis:** Input data is cleaned, normalized, and analyzed to ensure high-quality results.
- **Simulation and Validation:** Solutions are validated through simulation to assess their performance under various scenarios.
- **Visualization:** Results are visualized using plots and charts to facilitate analysis and interpretation.
